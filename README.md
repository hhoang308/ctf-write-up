# CTF Write-ups

This repository contains write-ups for various CTF (Capture The Flag) challenges that I have solved. The challenges are organized by category and stored in separate folders. Each folder contains a detailed `.md` explaining the analysis, exploitation, and solution for that specific challenge.

## Format of Write-ups

Each challenge folder contains:

- A `.md` file with a clear breakdown of the problem.
- Optional scripts, exploit code, or binary files (if not restricted).
- Clear explanation of techniques used to solve the challenge.
